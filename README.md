# Bootstrap-Project-3, Object Oriented JavaScript

**1 The aim of the laboratory**

The laboratory exercises aim to familiarize the student with using object modeling of the
data in JavaScript.

**1.1 Exercise 1**

Prepare the object containing information about the student using “Object prototypes”
1. First name
2. Last name
3. Age
4. Gender
5. Interests (at least 5)
6. Short description
7. Image (Face)
Add two functions:
 display the data in the form of Jumbotron of the Bootstrap library
 constructor for creating object instance.

**1.2 Exercise 2**

Prepare the Bootstrap Form display in the modal window for getting data about the student
defined in exercise 1. The modal window should be opened after clicking on the button “Add a
new Student data”
1. When the user adds a new data for the student, you should display next Jumbotron in
the same subpage
2. Key problem: How you can add many interests in the form. Most of the applications
use very ease solution – namely each interest can be stored in the next line of the edit
field. After clicking we have a source of the table of the interests which can be stored
inside the object.
